### A Distributed Virtualized Evolved Packet Core for LTE Networks (vEPC 1.1)
vEPC 1.1 is a distributed implementation of vEPC 1.0 (released on June 10, 2016). This new release adds horizontal scaling capabilities to the previous version to accommodate increasing load. 
#### Synopsis

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a popular concept being proposed for redesigning various components in telecom networks. A bulk of NFV design proposals focus on EPC, which faces severe scalability and flexibility issues. This has set a new trend among network equipment manufacturing companies to build commercial implementations of vEPC. All such implementations try to achieve a highly scalable and flexible architecture to suit the needs of future mobile traffic. However, no complete open-source free vEPC exists to the best of our knowledge. vEPC 1.0 released on June 10, 2016 was the first step in this direction. To extend our previous work we designed and implemented a distributed version which can horizontally scale to accommodate increasing load. Note that our code is not fully standards compliant, and is not intended for commercial use. Our code is intended for consumption by researchers to build and evaluate various NFV-based distributed EPC architectures. We are working on a future version to include auto scaling and other enhancements. 

#### High-level Design of vEPC 1.1
The new improved vEPC design is based on the idea of replacing monolithic EPC components with a distributed and stateless version. Namely monolithic MME, SGW, and PGW components are replaced with their respective distributed version. The following figure shows the complete design.
